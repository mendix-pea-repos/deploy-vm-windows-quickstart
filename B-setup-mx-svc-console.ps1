# -------------------------------------------------------------
#  The following steps should be completed manually
#
# Mendix Service Console UI
#
#       Select C:\Mendix as the location for apps
#       use C:\Mendix directory which has been created by the previous script
#       this will be used to store all Mendix projects in this demo  
#       create directory for storing mendix apps
#
#       Add App
#
#       Service Configuration
#               service name = MendixDemo
#               description = MendixDemo (make sure the name of the app in the service console is showing as MendixDemo)  
#               user = see A-setup-prereqs script. We defined the username there.
#               pwd =  see A-setup-prereqs script. We defined the username there.
#
#       Project Files
#               locate .mda file from desktop
#               press 'download server' to download the server gzip
#
#       Setup DB               
#               db type = postgres
#               localhost
#               name: MendixDemo
#               username=postgres, pw=test
#               if needed, troubleshoot connectivity with postgres  
#               psql "host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres password=test"
#
#       set java path on C:\ProgramFiles\eclipse\...\hotspot
#
#       start service
#       when prompted, agree to creating the new 'MendixDemo' db.
#
#
#       navigate to localhost:8080 and ensure the app is being served
#       by the Mendix Service Console
